	<p>
		Richard Tait is a painter and art tutor who has been based in London for twenty five years and has documented the City skyline in oil paint for the last seventeen years.
	</p>
	<p>
		Richard’s work explores the historical and modern aspects of the ever- changing London skyline and his cityscape paintings are a visual response to the movement and colour reflecting the vibrancy of the metropolis.
	</p>
	<p>
		The images are created using traditional materials and traditional methods and Richard depicts the City both during the daytime and at night when the colour fades and the dazzle of the light pollution takes over.
	</p>
	<p>
		Richard had his first solo show at Westbourne Studios in 2003 and has since shown his work at several London galleries including Spectrum fine Art, ING Bank and The Guildhall Art Gallery. His paintings are in collections in Austria, France, Holland, Ireland, Germany, Australia and Bermuda. Richard had a major solo show at the Masterworks Gallery in Bermuda and subsequently has over twenty paintings on the island including in the Masterworks Gallery collection and one at the Premier’s official residence.
	</p>
	<p>
		Richard is a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers and was awarded the Freedom of the City of London in 2007; he is also an Artists Fellow of Bermuda.
	</p>
	<p>
		A solo show of more than forty new paintings is scheduled for April next year in London.
